rdf2neo
=======
Still changing rapidly--use at your own risk!

The config file rdf2neo.json has an example in the resources directory. You need a rdf2neo.json in your classpath to be able to run the app--just copy the example file and use it.

With sbt installed, just use `sbt run` after cloning the repo.
